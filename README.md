# Detection-and-Prevention-of-IOT-Botnet-attack-using-Machine-Learning-
The project focuses on detecting and preventing IoT botnet attacks
using machine learning techniques. It involves analyzing network
traffic patterns to identify malicious activities and abnormal behaviors. Various ML models, such as decision trees and SVM, are trained
on IoT attack datasets. The goal is to enhance cybersecurity by implementing real-time threat detection and mitigation strategies.
